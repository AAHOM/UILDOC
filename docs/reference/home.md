# Reference Data Home

Many of the components described in this document display images or information that
is gathered from data stored (in various forms) in other blogs.  Most of the reference data
blog items are within a blog identifed as "Reference Data".  However there are exceptions, such as Flex Boxes, which are saved in a spearate Blog.

## Icon Bar

Icon Bars appear either attached to the top header image and/or the bottom footer on
all pages.  The icons displayed are saved in /reference-data/iconbar.  [Learn More about Icon Bar](../reference/reficonbar.html).

## Categories

The category list is a list of standard categories and associated groupings.  This list is
used primarily for grid filtering.  The categories are saved in /reference-data/categories as
a code block in CSV format. [Learn More about the Category List](../reference/refcategories.html).
