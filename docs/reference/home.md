# Reference Data Home

Many of the components described in this document display images or information that
is gathered from data stored (in various forms) in other blogs.  Most of the reference data
blog items are within a blog identifed as "Reference Data".  However there are exceptions, such as Flex Boxes, which are saved in a spearate Blog.

## Icon Bar

Icon Bars appear either attached to the top header image and/or the bottom footer on
all pages.  The icons displayed are saved in /reference-data/iconbar

The icon images are saved in a page gallery.  Add links to the "Clickthrough URL" by hovering over the icon (in edit mode) and clicking the wheel.
