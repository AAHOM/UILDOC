# Pick-a-Tool

This is a quick review of the tools available in the UIL Toolbox.   These tools generally present data from **SquareSpace Collections**.   Collections are files of either Blogs or Events.

## Carousel

The Carousel is an infinint loop of entries in a collection with previous and next
buttons on the left and right.  The number of items displayed can be defined as an
attribute when calling the carousel function.  Filtering (to limit items) based on SquareSpace categories is also available via attributes. [Learn More about carousels](../components/carousel.html).
