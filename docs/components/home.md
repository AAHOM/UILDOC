# Components Home

This is a quick review of the tools available in the UIL Toolbox.   These tools generally present data from **SquareSpace Collections**.   Collections are files of either Blogs or Events.

## Carousel

The Carousel is an infinint loop of entries in a collection with previous and next
buttons on the left and right.  The number of items displayed can be defined as an
attribute when calling the carousel function.  Filtering (to limit items) based on SquareSpace categories is also available via attributes. [Learn More about carousels](../components/carousel.html).

## Filtered Grid

This will display a SquareSpace collection (blog or events) as a grid with optional
filtering based on defined groups (see reference-data).  [Learn More about grids](../components/grids.html).

## Icon Bar

Icon Bars appear either attached to the top header image and/or the bottom footer on
all pages.  The icons displayed are saved in /reference-data/iconbar.  [Learn More about Icon Bars](../components/iconbar_new.html).

## Flex Boxes

Flip Boxes are individual slide shows that flip to the back side when hovered (or clicked on mobile devices).  The backside displays a short excerpt along with a link to the appropriate content.  This is desiged to work best with 3 flip boxes, but any number can be defined by overriding the default in attributes (see below).  FFlex bbox images and data are stored in a separate blog called "Flex Boxes" ("/flex-boxes").  Combinations of selections can be selected by defining categorires.   [Learn More about Flex Boxes](../components/flipboxes.html).
